Welcome to my personal website!

I am a diligent and conscientious scientist, driving ambitious research for the net-zero energy transition. I specialise in spectroscopy, photonic waveguides and solar energy harvesting. I am a Chartered Scientist, Chartered Engineer and Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA). I love deconstructing problems, working on interdisciplinary projects and innovating in collaboration. I possess a growth mindset and enjoy working on projects at the academic-commercial interface. 

Outside the lab, I like leading teams and taking up new challenges. I've captained two rowing clubs and organised entertainment events with 800+ guests. I champion the social mobility cause and am an ex-director of [Project Access International](https://projectaccess.org/), a charity committed to creating a world where passion and potential define a young person's future :smile:
