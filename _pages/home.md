Welcome to my personal website!

I am a materials scientist, driving ambitious research for the net-zero energy transition through harnessing light. I am a Chartered Scientist (CSci), Chartered Engineer (CEng) and Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA). I love deconstructing problems, working on interdisciplinary projects and innovating in collaboration. I possess a growth mindset and enjoy working on projects at the academic-commercial interface. 

Outside the lab, I like leading teams and taking up new challenges. I've captained two rowing clubs and organised entertainment events with 800+ guests. I champion the social mobility cause and am an ex-director of [Project Access International](https://projectaccess.org/){:target="_blank"}, a charity committed to creating a world where passion and potential define a young person's future. I currently volunteer as a STEM mentor for the [Windsor Fellowship](https://www.windsor-fellowship.org/programmes/stemm-chemical-sciences/){:target="_blank"}.
