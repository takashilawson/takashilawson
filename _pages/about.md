# Profile
A diligent and conscientious scientist, driving ambitious research for the net-zero energy transition. I specialise in spectroscopy, photonic waveguides and solar energy harvesting. I am a Chartered Scientist, Chartered Engineer and Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA). I love deconstructing problems, working on interdisciplinary projects and innovating in collaboration. I possess a growth mindset and work on projects at the academic-commercial interface. 

Outside the lab, I enjoy leading teams and taking up new challenges. I've captained two rowing clubs and organised entertainment events with 800+ guests. I champion the social mobility cause and am an ex-director of Slipstream Education and Project Access International, two charity start-ups committed to creating a world where passion and potential define a young person's future :smile:.

# Research Experience
I have scientific research experience in two areas related to the net-zero energy transition: (1) harnessing light to boost the efficiency of solar cells under diffuse indoor light and (2) harnessing light to produce solar fuels (i.e. green hydrogen) and chemicals. 

## Postdoctoral Research Associate | Sep 2021 - Present
In my current role, I lead on a collaborative scientific project between the University of Cambridge and McMaster University (Canada). I designed an optical setup to fabricate luminescent patterned films (or luminescent waveguide-encoded lattices - LWELs) for light harvesting. These patterned films are based on acrylate and epoxide polymers and can be applied to the surface of solar cells to boost efficiency. Ths work has resulted in the filing of a patent (US 63472150). 

*But why is this useful?* The Internet-of-Things (IoT), a network of sensors and actuators connected to computing systems, holds great commercial and societal potential, from streamlining operations to enhancing human health. Many of these will be “fit and forget” devices, creating an urgent demand for off-grid power sources. Currently, most IoT nodes are powered by batteries. However, battery replacement translates into incremental costs through the product life cycle, huge environmental impact during disposal, and significant safety risks in some applications. Could we recyle ambient indoor light to perpetually power these devices instead? LWELs are advanced polymer materials designed to boost the performance of solar cells under diffuse indoor light. The LWEL is retrofitted to the surface of a solar cell where it increases the angular collection of diffuse light and converts indoor light via photoluminescence to better match the spectral response of the underlying solar cell. LWELs are therefore designed to boost the power output of solar cells, such they have sufficient power to drive the networking protocols that underpin the IoT.

I have also led efforts to implement a 'living lab' where a network of internet-enabled lab sensors feed into a monitoring dashboard to easily quantify and assess the environmental impact of our research.

## Doctoral Research Student | Sep 2018 - Aug 2021
In my PhD, I developed a reaction monitoring technology to track photochemical reactions on ~100 nanolitre volumes. I built optofluidic setups for UV-Vis absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy, generating new kinetic and mechanistic insights into the performance of carbon dots (a light absorber) and cobaloximes (a hydrogen evolution catalyst). During my PhD, I became highly skilled in Python for data wrangling and analysis, and gained proficiency in DFT computational calculations (Gaussian 16) for predicting UV-Vis absorbance and Raman spectra based on molecularar struture.

*But why is this useful?* One method to create hydrogen cleanly is to split up the water molecule (H<sub>2</sub>O) into hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) using sunlight, just like a leaf on a plant. We can use special chemicals called photocatalysts to do this, which capture energy from sunlight to drive chemical reactions. The problem is no one really knows how these photocatalysts work! My project seeked to change this by using optical fibres, the same technology that gives us high-speed internet. Optical fibres are glass tubes around the diameter of a human hair, that guide light effectively. The fibres used in my research were hollow in the middle, so a liquid sample could be injected in. Light could be shone down one end of the fibre, and I oberved how the light changed as it interacted with the liquid sample. Specifically, chemicals interact with light in different ways, absorbing and emitting specific colours. These ‘spectroscopic signatures’ can be used to work out how are chemicals change and transform with time. The advantage of using optical fibres is the enhanced light-matter interaction over conventional chemical reactors, and the ultralow volumes mean I can minimise usage of expensive and precious samples.

# Teaching Experience
I am a Director of Studies at [Corpus Christi College](https://www.corpus.cam.ac.uk/subjects/natural-sciences-physical). I have a wide range of teaching experience across materials science, with a particular specialty in electro- and photo- materials for the energy transition. In recognition of my teaching practice, I was awarded a Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA).

## Lecturer and Assessor for MRes Nanoscience and Nanotechnology | Sep 2022 - Present
I was invited to lecture on light-matter interactions as part of the NE06 Nanochemistry course for the MRes Nanoscience and Nanotechnology in 2022-23 and 2023-24. I also convened the NE09 Nanoelectrochemistry course in 2023-24 and lectured on topics incuding electrochemistry and photoelectrochemistry (3 lectures and 1 examples class). As an appointed Assessor, I have marked project dissertations related to nanophotonics or nanochemistry. 

## Director of Studies in Materials Science | Oct 2021 - Present
I advise and mentor students specialising in materials science, including supporting them with internship applications. I have been a Director of Studies at Corpus Christi College since October 2021, and provided sabbatical cover at Jesus College from October 2022 to March 2023. I have also guided 16 A-level students from widening participation backgrounds through 21 tutorials in physics as part of the [STEM SMART](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/stem-smart) widening participation programme. I interview applicants for the BA/MSci Natural Sciences (Physical) as part of the admissions process.

## Supervisor for Part 1A Materials Science | Sep 2018 - Present
I lead small-group tutorials as part of the Part 1A (first-year) Materials Science course in the BA/MSci Natural Sciences, covering topics including crystallography, device materials, diffraction, microstructures, mechanical properties, biomaterials and materials under extreme environments. I facilitate learning through leading 12 small-group tutorials on these topics, with 2-4 tutorial groups per year.

## Lecturer for Part II Materials Science | Sep 2022 - Aug 2023
I lectured the Part II (third-year) C2 Electrochemical Materials course in the BA/MSci Natural Sciences, covering topics including electrochemistry, batteries, fuel cells and photoelectrochemical cells. I facilitated learning through delivering 6 lectures, 1 examples class and 1 small-group tutorial (6 groups). I also prepared one exam question as a summative assessment for the course, and marked the resulting exam scripts.
