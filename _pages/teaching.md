I am a Director of Studies at [Corpus Christi College](https://www.corpus.cam.ac.uk/subjects/natural-sciences-physical). I have a wide range of teaching experience across materials science, with a particular specialty in electro- and photo- materials for the energy transition. In recognition of my teaching practice, I was awarded a Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA).

## Lecturer and Assessor for MRes Nanoscience and Nanotechnology | Sep 2022 - Present
I was invited to lecture on light-matter interactions as part of the NE06 Nanochemistry course for the MRes Nanoscience and Nanotechnology in 2022-23 and 2023-24. I also convened the NE09 Nanoelectrochemistry course in 2023-24 and lectured on topics incuding electrochemistry and photoelectrochemistry (3 lectures and 1 examples class). As an appointed Assessor, I have marked project dissertations related to nanophotonics or nanochemistry. 

## Director of Studies in Materials Science | Oct 2021 - Present
I advise and mentor students specialising in materials science, including supporting them with internship applications. I have been a Director of Studies at Corpus Christi College since October 2021, and provided sabbatical cover at Jesus College from October 2022 to March 2023. I have also guided 16 A-level students from widening participation backgrounds through 21 tutorials in physics as part of the [STEM SMART](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/stem-smart) widening participation programme. I interview applicants for the BA/MSci Natural Sciences (Physical) as part of the admissions process.

## Supervisor for Part 1A Materials Science | Sep 2018 - Present
I lead small-group tutorials as part of the Part 1A (first-year) Materials Science course in the BA/MSci Natural Sciences, covering topics including crystallography, device materials, diffraction, microstructures, mechanical properties, biomaterials and materials under extreme environments. I facilitate learning through leading 12 small-group tutorials on these topics, with 2-4 tutorial groups per year.

## Lecturer for Part II Materials Science | Sep 2022 - Aug 2023
I lectured the Part II (third-year) C2 Electrochemical Materials course in the BA/MSci Natural Sciences, covering topics including electrochemistry, batteries, fuel cells and photoelectrochemical cells. I facilitated learning through delivering 6 lectures, 1 examples class and 1 small-group tutorial (6 groups). I also prepared one exam question as a summative assessment for the course, and marked the resulting exam scripts.
