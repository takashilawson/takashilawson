I am a Bye-Fellow and Director of Studies at [Corpus Christi College](https://www.corpus.cam.ac.uk/subjects/natural-sciences-physical){:target="_blank"}.
I teach across the breadth of materials science, with a focus on electrochemical and photoactive materials central to the net‑zero energy transition.
My commitment to high‑quality teaching was recognised with Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA) in 2023.

## Director of Studies in Materials Science
Since October 2021, I have mentored students specialising in materials science, supporting their academic development and job applications.
I serve as Director of Studies at Corpus Christi College and previously provided sabbatical cover at Jesus College (October 2022 – March 2023).
Through the [STEM SMART](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/stem-smart){:target="_blank"} widening‑participation programme, I have delivered 21 physics tutorials to 16 A‑level students from under‑represented backgrounds.
I also interview candidates for the BA/MSci Natural Sciences (Physical) as part of the University’s admissions process.

## Supervisor for Part 1A Materials Science
Since September 2018, I have taught small‑group tutorials in the first‑year Materials Science course for the BA/MSci Natural Sciences, covering topics such as crystallography, device materials, diffraction, microstructures, mechanical properties, biomaterials, and materials under extreme environments.
I typically lead 1–4 tutorial groups per year, delivering 21 tutorials across the course.

## Lecturer and Assessor for MRes Nanoscience and Nanotechnology
I was invited to lecture on light–matter interactions for the NE06 Nanochemistry course on the MRes in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology in 2022–23 and 2023–24.
In 2023–24, I convened the NE09 Nanoelectrochemistry course and delivered lectures on electrochemistry and photoelectrochemistry (three lectures and one examples class).
As an Assessor, I have marked project dissertations in nanophotonics, photochemistry, and materials science.

## Lecturer for Part II Materials Science
I lectured the third‑year C2 Electrochemical Materials course in the BA/MSci Natural Sciences in 2022–23, covering electrochemistry, batteries, fuel cells, and photoelectrochemical cells.
I facilitated learning through six lectures, one examples class, and one small‑group tutorial (six groups).
I also prepared an exam question as a summative assessment for the course and marked the resulting scripts.
